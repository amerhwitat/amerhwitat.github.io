### Private repository

`VanG` is currently private. It is intentionally excluded from public publication and is not described as a public mirror. Its visibility remains under the account owner's control.

## Publication and hosting policy

GitHub is the current canonical public forge. Git history is the portable source-history layer. GitLab, Codeberg/Forgejo, SourceHut, WordPress and image-hosting services are secondary publication targets only when a user-controlled account/repository is connected and the resulting write succeeds.

A search-engine result or a public URL is not treated as proof that material has been published or indexed. Publication records should contain the destination URL, publication date, asset name and source repository.

## Image assets

Chimera II visual assets should be stored in repository-controlled `web/` or `assets/` directories and referenced from the public website before optional mirroring to external image hosts. This provides a durable source even if a third-party host changes or removes an asset.

## Provenance and licensing

Third-party source is not copied merely because it is publicly accessible. Adaptations require compatible licensing and preservation of notices. Research references should link to upstream projects and standards. See `docs/CRYPTO_UPSTREAMS_AND_PROVENANCE.md` for the crypto-specific provenance and safety boundary.

## Security boundary

Crypto research in this ecosystem is limited to legitimate key material already possessed by the operator, deterministic derivation, validation, published test vectors, benchmarking and interoperability. No repository should implement public-address-to-private-key search, guessing, inference or wallet-targeted recovery.
