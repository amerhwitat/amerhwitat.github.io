# Chimera II OS Quantum + Multidimensional + Rust Design

## Goal
Extend Chimera II OS with a native research-oriented quantum computing subsystem, a Rust implementation of the OS/runtime boundary, and a mathematically explicit multidimensional/perspective research layer while preserving the existing Koronos/Spit Fire/Jasper/Spotnik/RegisterN architecture.

## Scope

1. **Quantum research subsystem** under `quantum/` with portable simulator primitives, hybrid CPU/GPU/QPU adapters, algorithm examples, deterministic tests, and language bindings.
2. **Rust edition** under `rust/ChimeraIIOS/`, implementing a safe user-space/runtime layer first and exposing interfaces that can later be lowered into freestanding/kernel components without pretending that Rust code alone is a bootable kernel.
3. **Perspective + multidimensional mathematics** under `multidimensional/` with equations, reference implementations, tests, and a clear distinction between established mathematics/physics and the user's 128D research model.
4. **Cross-language parity** for C, C++, Rust, Python, Java, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin, Swift/Objective-C, and Dart/Flutter where those language trees exist. The portable specification is authoritative; each implementation may use native libraries only behind explicit adapters.
5. **Source provenance**: internet research informs clean-room implementations and adapter boundaries. Third-party source is not copied wholesale. Each dependency records URL, version, license, and integration purpose.

## Quantum architecture

### Core model
- Qubit register with configurable width.
- Complex amplitudes and sparse/dense state representations.
- Gate matrices and controlled operations.
- Tensor-product composition.
- State-vector measurement and deterministic seeded sampling.
- Density matrices and quantum channels for mixed-state/noise research.
- Circuit IR with versioned JSON representation.
- Backend interface: CPU simulator, optional GPU simulator, external QPU provider adapter.
- Hybrid execution interface for classical + quantum workloads.

### Initial algorithms
- Bell state and GHZ state.
- Quantum teleportation.
- Deutsch-Jozsa.
- Bernstein-Vazirani.
- Grover search.
- Quantum Fourier Transform.
- Phase estimation.
- Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) reference workflow.
- QAOA reference workflow.
- Quantum walk.
- Small educational Shor factoring demonstration.

Algorithms are research/educational implementations and must not be represented as fault-tolerant production quantum computing.

### External ecosystem adapters
Research targets include Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane, NVIDIA CUDA-Q and cuQuantum. Qiskit exposes Python and C APIs and its internal data model is Rust-based; Cirq provides Python circuit construction/simulation; PennyLane targets quantum computing, quantum machine learning and quantum chemistry; CUDA-Q provides C++/Python hybrid CPU/GPU/QPU programming; cuQuantum supplies high-performance quantum simulation libraries and C/C++ samples. citeturn0search7turn0search6turn0search2turn0search0turn0search4

Chimera II OS will use these as optional integration targets, not hard runtime dependencies. CUDA-Q's official documentation currently describes Linux x86_64/ARM64 and macOS ARM64 support, with Windows use through WSL, so the native Chimera simulator remains the portable baseline. citeturn0search12

## Multidimensional + perspective architecture

The research layer separates:

- **Geometry**: coordinates, vectors, tensors, metrics, transformations and projections.
- **Perspective**: an observer/reference frame, projection operator, sensor model and uncertainty/knowledge state.
- **Physical models**: established mathematical/physical equations such as Euclidean/affine transformations, inner products, tensor contractions, probability, Fourier transforms and quantum state evolution.
- **128D research model**: a configurable 128-component semantic state space used as an experimental computational representation. It is explicitly labeled as a research framework, not an established physical claim that spacetime has 128 physical dimensions.

Canonical equations to implement and test include:

- Vector norm: `||x|| = sqrt(sum_i x_i^2)`.
- Inner product: `<x,y> = sum_i x_i y_i`.
- Tensor contraction: `C_ij = sum_k A_ik B_kj`.
- Affine transform: `x' = A x + b`.
- Perspective projection: `y = P(x - o)` where `o` is observer position/reference origin and `P` is a projection operator.
- Probability normalization: `sum_i p_i = 1`.
- Quantum normalization: `<psi|psi> = 1`.
- Schrödinger evolution: `i hbar d|psi>/dt = H|psi>`.
- Density evolution: `rho' = U rho U^dagger`.
- Born probability: `p(i) = |<i|psi>|^2`.
- Fourier transform: `X_k = sum_n x_n exp(-2 pi i kn/N)`.
- Einstein-style index contraction examples for general tensors.
- Observer/perception overlay: `z = f(P x, context, uncertainty)` as a software abstraction, not a new physical law.

## Rust implementation

`rust/ChimeraIIOS/` will contain:
- Cargo workspace and crates for `chm-core`, `chm-register`, `chm-isa`, `chm-quantum`, `chm-multidim`, and `chm-cli`.
- `no_std`-compatible core traits where practical, with a standard-library CLI/runtime layer.
- Safe wrappers for RegisterN-style wide integers and byte/hex operations.
- Quantum state/circuit simulator using explicit complex arithmetic.
- Multidimensional vector/tensor primitives.
- C ABI bridge definitions for interoperability with existing C/C++ components.
- Tests and examples runnable on desktop Linux/macOS/Windows.

## Compatibility and safety

- No private keys, credentials, or network secrets in quantum examples.
- No external quantum service is contacted unless an adapter is explicitly configured by the operator.
- No third-party source is vendored unless its license permits redistribution and its license text is preserved.
- Existing OS components remain source-compatible; quantum support is an optional subsystem.
- Deterministic test vectors use fixed seeds.

## Documentation

Update root README and component indexes, add `docs/QUANTUM_COMPUTING.md`, `docs/MULTIDIMENSIONAL_PERSPECTIVE.md`, `docs/RUST_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `docs/QUANTUM_SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md`, and a language compatibility matrix. Add citations to source repositories and official documentation.

## Acceptance criteria

- Native Chimera quantum simulator can build and execute the Bell, GHZ, teleportation, Grover and QFT examples.
- Quantum circuit/state serialization has a versioned schema and deterministic test vectors.
- Rust workspace builds and tests on supported desktop targets and exposes documented C ABI boundaries.
- Multidimensional math library passes vector/tensor/projection/quantum normalization tests, including 128D examples.
- Existing C/C++ architecture documentation links to the new modules without changing the boot contract.
- Python/JS/TS and other available language implementations expose the same portable circuit and multidimensional concepts through native-language adapters.
- Documentation clearly distinguishes established theory from the experimental 128D/perspective framework.
