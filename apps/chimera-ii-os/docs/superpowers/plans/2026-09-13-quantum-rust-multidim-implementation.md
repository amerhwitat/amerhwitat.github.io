# Chimera II OS Quantum + Rust + Multidimensional Implementation Plan

## Goal
Extend Chimera II OS with a clean-room quantum-computing layer, a first-class Rust implementation, and a mathematically explicit perspective/multidimensional runtime while preserving the existing boot ABI and language-specific source organization.

## Research inputs
- Qiskit: circuit IR, primitives, provider separation.
- Cirq: circuit construction and simulator abstractions.
- PennyLane: hybrid quantum/classical workflows and differentiation.
- NVIDIA CUDA-Q: heterogeneous CPU/GPU/QPU orchestration.
- Rust Spinoza: state-vector simulator architecture and Rust performance patterns.
- qsim: C++ simulator/API boundary concepts.

All implementations in Chimera II OS are clean-room equivalents. Upstream source is not copied; provenance and licenses remain documented.

## Workstreams
1. Quantum core: deterministic state-vector simulator, gate operations, measurement, circuit IR, C ABI and language adapters.
2. Quantum acceleration: backend trait and optional GPU/QPU/provider adapters; never require credentials for local builds.
3. Rust: workspace with core, register, ISA, quantum, multidim and CLI crates; safe user-space runtime first.
4. Multidimensional mathematics: vector/tensor/affine primitives, observer transforms, projection, uncertainty/perception overlays, and 128D experimental semantic profile.
5. Language parity: update C/C++, C, Python, Java, C#, Node/TypeScript/JavaScript, Kotlin, Swift/Objective-C boundary, Dart/Flutter and Rust documentation/adapters.
6. Testing: Bell state, normalization, measurement, tensor contraction, perspective projection, serialization and cross-language fixture tests.
7. Documentation: architecture, equations, API contracts, provenance, compatibility matrix, build/run instructions and limitations.
8. Automation: CMake, Cargo and language CI jobs; verify local simulators without external services.

## Acceptance criteria
- Quantum local simulator works without a cloud provider.
- Rust workspace has a compilable design and no dependency on proprietary SDKs.
- Perspective and geometry are explicitly separated.
- 128D is labeled experimental rather than established physical theory.
- Existing boot ABI remains unchanged.
- Third-party code is not copied; provenance is retained.
- Tests cover Bell state and core multidimensional operations.
- Documentation links every major implementation and states what is verified versus platform-dependent.
