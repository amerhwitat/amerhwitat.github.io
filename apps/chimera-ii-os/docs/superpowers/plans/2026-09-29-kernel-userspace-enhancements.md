# Chimera II Kernel + User Space Enhancements Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Extend Chimera II OS kernel and user space into a coherent, testable platform for Koronos parallel services, native desktop operation, Windows/NT compatibility, PE execution, graphics/input, security, storage, networking, diagnostics, and recovery without destabilizing the existing boot path.

**Architecture:** Keep Koronos as the kernel scheduler/IPC/interrupt/runtime foundation and Kore as the service/object-management layer. Build user-space capabilities as independent services with explicit dependencies and health states; Windows compatibility remains an ABI/runtime layer over native Chimera services rather than a second kernel. Implement each subsystem incrementally with host-side tests before ISO integration.

**Tech Stack:** C/C++20, C11, x86-64 boot/runtime, ASM, CMake, existing Koronos/Kore/Aurora architecture, Python for build/inspection tooling, JSON service/compatibility manifests.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-29-kernel-userspace-enhancements.md` plus the approved Windows/NT desktop compatibility design from the preceding conversation.

## Global Constraints

- Preserve the existing Koronos boot handoff and Multiboot2 module ABI.
- Do not replace Koronos with a second scheduler; Windows-compatible threads map onto the native scheduler.
- Keep kernel code freestanding where required; user-space code must not introduce kernel-only dependencies.
- Windows compatibility implementations must be original/clean-room compatible interfaces; do not copy proprietary Windows implementation or confidential source.
- PE loading must validate architecture, bounds, sections, relocations, imports, exports, TLS and entry-point state before execution.
- No claim of successful ISO/runtime execution until the corresponding local or CI verification actually passes.
- Every service target must expose explicit state, dependencies, startup diagnostics and failure behavior.
- Build scripts must remain resumable and must not silently execute documentation/code examples embedded in heredocs.

## Review Focus

- Scheduler starvation/re-entrancy and persistent READY/RUNNING/BLOCKED/EXITED lifecycle — covered by scheduler stress tests.
- Malformed/cross-architecture PE files and unsafe import/relocation data — covered by PE loader negative tests.
- GUI message storms and blocked UI threads — covered by message-queue and wait/wake tests.
- Parallel service dependency cycles/failures — covered by target-graph tests.
- Boot/ISO regression after adding services — covered by ELF, manifest, ISO-content and boot-contract verification.
