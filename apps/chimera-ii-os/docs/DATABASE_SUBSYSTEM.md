# Database Subsystem and Open-Source Backend Strategy

Chimera II OS now defines a database service boundary for relational, embedded, analytical, key-value, document and wide-column workloads. Nucleus remains the OS-level HTAP abstraction; external engines are selected behind adapters.

Recommended baseline:

- SQLite for boot metadata, local configuration and recovery state.
- DuckDB for local analytics, Parquet/JSON processing and research workloads.
- MariaDB Community Server for conventional multi-user SQL services.
- PostgreSQL for advanced transactional, extension and research workloads.
- RocksDB/LevelDB for embedded LSM storage.
- Valkey for caching, queues, streams and distributed key/value state.
- Apache Cassandra for distributed wide-column/event workloads.
- Apache CouchDB for HTTP/JSON document workloads.

ISO-Tool should build these as optional packages rather than forcing every ISO to contain every server. Package manifests record source URL, exact version, license, checksum, compiler requirements and build outcome.

Third-party binaries are not copied into the repository. The integration layer is original Chimera code plus metadata pointing to upstream projects.
