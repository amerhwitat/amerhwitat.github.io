# Chimera II OS RISC/CISC ISA Catalog

Chimera II OS maintains two complementary machine-readable ISA resources:

- `isa/catalog.json` — the richer structured instruction catalog with worked binary/hex samples, operand objects and architecture-family metadata.
- `ISA.csv` — the portable tabular export requested for build, analysis and spreadsheet tooling. It records architecture, RISC/CISC class, mnemonic, syntax, binary encoding/template, hexadecimal encoding/template, operands, optional operands and notes.

## Coverage

| Family | Class | Encoding model | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| RISC-V | RISC | 16/32/long optional encodings; RV32I/RV64I | ADD, SUB, ADDI, LW, SW |

| VAX | CISC | variable length opcode + operand specifiers | HALT, NOP, RET, RSB, BRB |

## Operand and encoding model

Each CSV row identifies the operand fields and optional operands. An ISA instruction does not always have one universal hexadecimal value: register numbers, immediates, displacements, ModRM/SIB fields, branch offsets and addressing modes change the encoded bits. Therefore `ISA.csv` uses an exact literal encoding for fixed instructions and an explicit template/expression for variable fields.

The supplied architecture material explains that an instruction contains an opcode and operands, and that machine language is the CPU's binary instruction format. fileciteturn90file0L38-L48 It also describes RISC fixed-length versus CISC variable-length instruction formats. fileciteturn90file0L125-L147 The second supplied lecture identifies operation repertoire, data types, instruction format, registers and addressing as fundamental ISA design issues. fileciteturn90file1L5-L30

## Validation and ISO integration

`tools/isa/validate-isa.py` validates the CSV schema and architecture coverage. The ISO preparation script copies `ISA.csv` into `/src/ISA.csv`, and the ISO build invokes the validator before mastering the ISO. GitHub Actions also validates the catalog before the Docker ISO build.

## Completeness policy

The phrase “all CISC and RISC processors” cannot be represented honestly as one finite instruction list without defining a revision, extension set and vendor scope. Processor families have revisions, optional extensions, privileged instructions, vector/crypto extensions, aliases and implementation-specific encodings. Chimera therefore maintains a cross-architecture base catalog and preserves the richer JSON catalog as the extensible source. Architecture-specific decoder/encoder tables should be added from each architecture's normative manual when that ISA is enabled for native execution.

## Chimera-specific ISA

The C8192/R8192 research ISA remains separate from external industry-standard ISA definitions. Chimera-specific encodings should be registered under a dedicated family ID and must not be represented as Intel/AMD/Arm/RISC-V/MIPS/Power/SPARC encodings.
