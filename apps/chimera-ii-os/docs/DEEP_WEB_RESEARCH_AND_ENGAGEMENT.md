# Chimera II OS — Deep Web Research & Community Engagement Plan

## Purpose

This document records a research-backed publication strategy for Chimera II OS across free static hosting, blogs, video platforms, technical communities and search engines. The goal is discoverability through useful technical material, not bulk promotion.

## Canonical source policy

The canonical technical source is:

- https://github.com/amerhwitat/ChimeraIIOS
- https://amerhwitat.github.io/chimera/

Mirrors should link to these sources. Search engines may cluster duplicate pages, so copies should use canonical references and should not imply that a mirror is the primary implementation.

## Free static hosting research

### GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages hosts static HTML/CSS/JavaScript directly from GitHub repositories and is available for public repositories on GitHub Free. It is the primary public portal for Chimera II OS.

Official documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages

### GitLab Pages

GitLab Pages is available on the Free tier and publishes static sites through GitLab infrastructure and CI/CD. It supports plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Wasm and static site generators. A GitLab account/project authorization is required before an external mirror can be created.

Official documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/pages/

### Codeberg Pages

Codeberg Pages provides free static user/organization and repository websites through `codeberg.page`. The current documentation notes the migration to the newer git-pages implementation and recommends the current deployment approach for new users.

Official documentation: https://docs.codeberg.org/codeberg-pages/

### Cloudflare Pages

Cloudflare Pages supports static deployments from Git repositories. The current Free plan has documented limits including 500 builds per month, up to 20,000 files per site and a 25 MiB single-file asset limit. Static asset requests are free; larger media should be handled separately rather than copying large video archives into the Pages asset tree.

Official documentation: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/limits/

## Blog and article research

### WordPress.com

WordPress.com currently provides a free plan with hosting, unlimited pages/posts and 1 GB media storage. This makes the connected `amerserver4.wordpress.com` site suitable for the long-form project announcement and a curated documentation index. The WPWriter connection is currently awaiting the user's WordPress admin authorization click.

Official documentation: https://wordpress.com/support/plan-features/

### Blogger

Google's Blogger documentation supports creation of blogs, posts, pages and labels. It is a reasonable secondary blog mirror once the user's Google/Blogger account is explicitly authorized.

Official documentation: https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/1623800

### Medium

Medium supports publishing stories and submitting stories to independently operated publications. A Medium mirror should be shorter and editorially focused rather than copying the entire repository documentation.

Official documentation: https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/213904978-How-to-submit-a-story-to-a-publication

### Substack

Use a user-controlled Substack publication as a newsletter-oriented mirror only after account authorization. The preferred material is project updates, research notes and release announcements, with canonical links back to GitHub.

## Search discovery

Google's current documentation states that sitemaps help discovery but do not guarantee crawling, indexing or ranking. Google also recommends canonical URLs when substantially identical content appears at multiple URLs. The existing Chimera web portal therefore keeps a sitemap and robots file while treating the GitHub repository/web portal as the canonical source.

Official documentation:

- https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing
- https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap
- https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/canonicalization

Search submission is only performed when the site owner can authenticate the property. Do not claim an indexing submission merely because a sitemap exists.

## Technical community research targets

### OS development

OSDev is highly relevant for bootloaders, kernels, MMU design, filesystems, drivers, ABI design and emulator testing. Recent community discussions show active interest in custom architectures and custom-ISA operating systems. Chimera posts should therefore lead with a concrete technical question, benchmark or reproducible artifact rather than a general advertisement.

Useful discussion context: https://www.reddit.com/r/osdev/

### RISC-V ISA development

The RISC-V ISA Development community is directly relevant to custom instruction encoding, extension composition and accelerator interfaces. Community discussions emphasize that custom extensions are project-specific and that independently authored extensions can create encoding/composition problems. Chimera's C8192/R8192 work can be presented as an experimental architecture and compared carefully with these established design constraints.

Community archive: https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/g/isa-dev

### Hacker News and general systems communities

Hacker News can be appropriate for a substantial technical launch when the post contains a concrete artifact, such as a simulator demo, benchmark, architecture paper or source release. Avoid posting repeated promotional links. A successful submission should explain what is technically unusual and invite substantive critique.

## Research themes to emphasize

1. **Perspective vs geometry in computing** — relate the user's 128D Framework to a clearly separated research hypothesis rather than presenting it as an established scientific law.
2. **Wide-word computing** — compare 4096/8192-bit virtual registers with conventional SIMD/vector/tensor architectures and explain where wide words are useful or inefficient.
3. **C8192 vs R8192** — explain the experimental CISC variable-width and RISC fixed-width design trade-offs.
4. **RegisterN** — present width-parametric arithmetic as an emulator/library abstraction that can scale without claiming that hardware of arbitrary width already exists.
5. **OS/ISA co-design** — show how boot ABI, scheduler, IPC, networking, filesystem and toolchain decisions interact with an experimental ISA.
6. **Virtualization and simulation** — emphasize CPU4096/CPU4096Simulator as reproducible software research vehicles before any hardware claims.
7. **Zero-copy networking** — discuss AF_XDP/Netmap concepts and measurable benchmarks rather than unverified performance claims.
8. **Filesystem interoperability** — distinguish native support, read-only support, userspace adapters and planned/emulated support for Linux, BSD, Windows, OpenVMS and legacy systems.
9. **Toolchain portability** — document assembler, disassembler, compiler, linker, debugger and emulator boundaries.
10. **Neural/128D research** — separate conceptual models from validated ML experiments and provide reproducible datasets/benchmarks where possible.

## Community comment policy

The project should never mass-comment unrelated videos or posts. Use comments only where they contribute technical value.

### Pattern A — answering a custom-ISA discussion

> Interesting point about custom instruction encoding. Chimera II OS is exploring a separate experimental C8192/R8192 ISA, so we're treating opcode allocation, extension composition and toolchain compatibility as first-class design problems. The implementation/research notes are public at https://github.com/amerhwitat/ChimeraIIOS. I'd be interested in feedback on encoding and ABI trade-offs.

### Pattern B — answering an OS-development discussion

> One approach we've been experimenting with is to co-design the boot ABI, microkernel and virtual ISA instead of treating the CPU and OS as independent layers. Chimera II OS uses Spit Fire/Jasper for the boot path, Koronos for the kernel and CPU4096/CPU4096Simulator for the virtual-processor side. Source: https://github.com/amerhwitat/ChimeraIIOS

### Pattern C — discussing wide registers

> We're experimenting with 4096- and 8192-bit virtual registers for crypto, tensor-style operations and bulk data movement. The interesting question for us is not simply "make the register wider", but where the wider representation actually improves the algorithm, memory traffic or instruction semantics. The simulator is public for reproducibility: https://github.com/amerhwitat/ChimeraIIOS

### Pattern D — publication announcement

> Chimera II OS is now being organized as a public research ecosystem: custom C8192/R8192 ISA work, CPU4096 simulation, Koronos kernel research, Aurora desktop, networking, filesystems, toolchain/IDE work and the 128D research track. This is experimental research rather than a claim of a finished production OS or fabricated CPU. Source and documentation: https://github.com/amerhwitat/ChimeraIIOS

## Comment safety and reputation rules

- Never paste the same comment across unrelated communities.
- Never automate comments or replies.
- Never hide the project's affiliation.
- Never claim a specification is ratified when it is a research draft.
- Never claim silicon/hardware implementation unless independently verified.
- Never claim indexing, hosting or publication before an authenticated write produces a retrievable URL.
- Prefer a direct technical answer over a project link.
- Use the shortest link necessary and only when relevant.
- Respect each community's self-promotion rules.

## Provenance

The current Library source material includes the Chimera II OS Developer Guide, kernel hardening notes and IEEE-style/R8192/C8192 specification drafts. These documents describe the project's intended architecture and research direction; publication copy must label implementation status accurately.

Relevant Library evidence includes the Developer Guide's boot chain, Koronos, Spotnik, VFS, Aurora, CEF, security, ISA tooling and QEMU/CI sections, plus the IEEE-style material describing the R8192/C8192 ISA, 8192-bit registers and networking integration.
