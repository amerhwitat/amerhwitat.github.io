# Chimera II Computational Research Baseline — 2026

This document separates established engineering practice from active research directions.

## 1. Temporal computation

Classical RNNs remain useful when stateful temporal processing is required, but long-context training can be expensive or unstable. State-space models provide another recurrent-style abstraction with efficient sequence processing and are an appropriate optional backend for Chimera's temporal cognition layer.

Research example: state-space models have been evaluated as efficient neural operators for dynamical systems and compared against RNNs, transformers and other baselines. https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03231

## 2. Neuro-symbolic computation

Chimera's 128D conceptual model can be implemented as a separation between:

- symbolic facts and constraints;
- learned embeddings;
- graph relations;
- temporal state;
- retrieval evidence;
- generated hypotheses.

This gives the system an auditable path from a hypothesis back to evidence rather than treating neural output as truth.

Neuro-symbolic knowledge-graph research explicitly combines learned representations with logical constraints/rule reasoning. https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10390

## 3. Graph + language computation

Knowledge graphs can provide explicit structure for retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Chimera should use graph storage for entities, relations, source provenance and temporal versions, while neural components operate over retrieved subgraphs.

## 4. Edge and distributed learning

The Chimera node model should support:

- local inference;
- local evidence stores;
- optional federated learning;
- peer summaries;
- provenance-aware synchronization;
- disconnected operation with later reconciliation.

The synchronization protocol must exchange data/model artifacts only with explicit policy and authentication.

## 5. Neuromorphic and accelerator research

The OS should expose an accelerator-neutral interface so future implementations can target:

- GPU compute;
- NPU/AI accelerators;
- FPGA;
- vector/SIMD units;
- spiking/neuromorphic devices;
- Chimera R8192/R8192-wide arithmetic extensions.

The 8192-bit ISA is therefore a systems research substrate, not an assumption that wider integer registers automatically produce better AI.

## 7. Engineering best practices

- deterministic tests for every kernel/ISA operation;
- capability-based privileged operations;
- reproducible builds;
- signed artifacts;
- SBOM and provenance;
- fuzzing for parsers and binary formats;
- fault injection for storage/network drivers;
- graceful degradation from accelerated to software rendering;
- immutable/transactional OS generations;
- explicit rollback paths;
- observability from boot to user-space cognition.

## 8. Non-goals

The current repository must not claim that the prototype is AGI, superintelligence, conscious, or scientifically validated as a brain simulation. Those are research hypotheses. The engineering target is a modular operating environment capable of hosting increasingly capable computational, graph, neural and distributed-learning components.
