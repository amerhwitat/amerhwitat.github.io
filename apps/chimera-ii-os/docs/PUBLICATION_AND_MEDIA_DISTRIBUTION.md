# Chimera II OS — Publication & Media Distribution Registry

## Canonical publication

- GitHub source of record: https://github.com/amerhwitat/ChimeraIIOS
- Public web portal: https://amerhwitat.github.io/chimera/
- Portfolio summary: `docs/CHIMERA_ECOSYSTEM_PORTFOLIO.md`
- Deep web research and community engagement plan: `docs/DEEP_WEB_RESEARCH_AND_ENGAGEMENT.md`

## Search discovery and indexing

The public web portal carries expanded SEO metadata, Open Graph metadata, Schema.org structured data, a same-site XML sitemap and `robots.txt`. These improve crawler discovery but do not guarantee ranking or indexing.

- Google Search: sitemap/URL submission requires the site owner to verify the property in Search Console. Google supports sitemap submission and individual URL indexing requests. No authenticated Search Console submission was performed from this session.
- Bing: IndexNow and Bing Webmaster URL submission are supported, but an authenticated verified site/API key is required for direct submission. No authenticated Bing submission was performed from this session.
- Other search engines: discovery normally occurs through crawling, sitemaps, backlinks and their own webmaster tools; there is no universal API that can force indexing across every engine.

Google's current guidance also recommends canonical URLs when the same content exists in multiple places. Therefore, the GitHub repository/web portal remain the source of record, while mirrors and blog posts should link back to the canonical material rather than creating uncontrolled duplicate copies.

## Current free-hosting research

The current major free/static targets reviewed for this publication cycle are GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, Codeberg Pages and Cloudflare Pages. They are suitable for the static public portal and documentation package, but they have different deployment/account requirements and limits. The repository remains the canonical source rather than treating any one host as the master copy.

## Library-source package

The publication package may incorporate the user's Library material, preserving the original filename/version and provenance. Current relevant source documents include:

- `Pasted markdown(5).md` — Chimera II OS Developer Guide Markdown, including boot chain, Koronos, Spotnik, VFS/filesystems, Aurora, CEF, security, ISA tooling and QEMU/CI material.
- `Chimera II OS Developer Guide.txt` — corresponding developer guide and kernel hardening material.
- `Pasted markdown(2).md` — ISA/networking implementation material.
- `✅ PART I — Full IEEE‑Style Specific.txt` — standards-style specification material covering architecture, dual-stack networking, R8192/C8192, 8192-bit registers, tensor/crypto/network instructions and simulator integration.

The Library documents are source material, not evidence that every described subsystem is already implemented in production hardware. Public copy must distinguish specifications, research designs, implementation artifacts, simulations, generated drafts and verified code.

## Library video manifest

The Library contains 3 video files in the broader media scope:

| File | Duration | Size | Intended publication |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `Chimera II OS Neural Simulator Execution Cycle.mp4` | 6.08 s | 3,506,419 bytes | Chimera II OS video channels |
| `chimera_ii_os_musical_video.mp4` | 45.00 s | 3,539,070 bytes | Chimera II OS video channels |
| `PixVerse_V6_Image_Text_360P_Children_in_Gaza_f.mp4` | 5.04 s | 2,694,901 bytes | Separate/non-Chimera media; publish only where the owner intends it to be public |

The files are Library assets, not remote-host uploads. Upload URLs must be recorded here only after successful authenticated publication.

## Video publication metadata

Recommended short description for Chimera videos:

> Chimera II OS — open research ecosystem covering Koronos, Aurora, C8192/R8192 ISA research, CPU4096 simulation, mobile/web interfaces and neural/virtual-processor experimentation. Source and documentation: https://github.com/amerhwitat/ChimeraIIOS

Recommended tags:

`Chimera II OS`, `ChimeraIIOS`, `Amer Hwitat`, `Koronos`, `C8192`, `R8192`, `CPU4096`, `CPU Simulator`, `RISC`, `CISC`, `Operating System`, `Virtual Processor`, `ISA`, `Aurora Desktop`, `Neural Simulation`, `128D Framework`, `Open Source`, `Linux`, `Unix`, `WebGL`, `Compiler`, `IDE`.

## Comments and community interaction

The publication workflow does **not** automate bulk comments on unrelated YouTube videos, Reddit posts, forums, or other communities. Repetitive unsolicited promotion can be treated as spam and can damage the project's reputation.

The approved engagement model is:

1. Publish the project's own material first.
2. Participate only in genuinely relevant technical discussions.
3. Answer the discussion's question before mentioning Chimera II OS.
4. Disclose that Chimera is the author's project when linking it.
5. Use a different, context-specific comment rather than repeating one promotional block.
6. Prefer technical artifacts, benchmarks, ISA tables, diagrams, reproducible tests and source links over hype.
7. Do not misrepresent research/specification material as silicon, a production OS release, or a ratified standard.
8. Do not mass-post or automate comments.

A suitable short disclosure when directly relevant:

> I'm working on Chimera II OS, an open research OS/virtual-processor project exploring C8192/R8192 ISA design, CPU4096 simulation, Aurora desktop and neural/128D research. The architecture and code are public here: https://github.com/amerhwitat/ChimeraIIOS

## Publication record rule

An entry is changed to **Published** only after a successful authenticated write and a retrievable destination URL is available. Search results, previews, generated links or intended destinations are not treated as publication evidence.

## Image distribution

The durable source for Chimera visuals is the repository/web tree. Recommended structure:

```text
web/assets/chimera/
  aurora/
  mobile/
  architecture/
  cpu/
  isa/
  screenshots/
```

External image hosts should receive copies only after the source image is identified and the account/host is authorized. Every published copy should record its canonical source path and destination URL.

## Content package

The publication package consists of:

1. Repository portfolio summary.
2. Chimera II architecture overview.
3. CPU4096 → CPU4096Simulator → C8192/R8192 lineage.
4. Aurora desktop and Mobile Edition overview.
5. Python and Java implementation tracks.
6. NLP and PDF research tooling.
7. Crypto interoperability and provenance boundary.
8. Public repository links and author bibliography.
9. Licensing/provenance statement.
10. Image/diagram manifest.
11. Video manifest, descriptions, tags and destination records.
12. Search-engine discovery metadata and sitemap.
13. Deep-web research and community-engagement guidance.

## Privacy and licensing

Private repositories are never presented as public mirrors. Third-party images and code are not republished without appropriate rights and attribution. Proprietary or confidential material remains excluded from public publication.
