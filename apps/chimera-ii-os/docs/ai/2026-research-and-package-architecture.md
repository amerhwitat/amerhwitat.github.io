# Chimera II OS — 2026 AI, Parallel and Package Architecture

## Research-derived integrations

Chimera now tracks current implementation directions including speculative inference, self-speculative MoE, adaptive tensor parallelism, topology-aware heterogeneous scheduling, KV-cache optimization, quantization, structured sparsity, DNN partitioning for cooperative edge inference, federated learning, zero-copy I/O and IoT-edge-cloud orchestration.

The implementation uses provider-neutral boundaries rather than copying third-party source. IREE is a key target because it is an MLIR-based compiler/runtime supporting Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, bare metal and WebAssembly, plus x86, ARM and RISC-V and GPU APIs including Vulkan, ROCm/HIP, CUDA and Metal.

## Cross-platform package management

`package/chimera_pkg.py` supplies a Brew-like command interface. It discovers packages through installed platform providers and keeps package metadata separate from installers.

### Planned provider adapters

- Linux: apt, dnf, pacman, zypper, apk, Nix and native Chimera repository.
- Windows: WinGet/Microsoft Store/MSIX provider.
- macOS: Homebrew-compatible provider and signed App Store/distribution provider.

The OS cannot universally install a Windows Store or Apple App Store application as though it were an ordinary Linux package. Windows distribution depends on MSIX/Store/direct installer mechanisms and signing; Apple distribution depends on App Store Connect, notarization, platform rules and, for alternative distribution, region-specific eligibility. Chimera therefore exposes a unified search/install API while delegating final installation to the authoritative platform provider.

## Security policy

- no automatic executable download without authorization
- verify signatures and hashes
- dependency graph before installation
- sandbox and permission checks
- transactional install/rollback
- architecture/ABI compatibility checks
- license/store entitlement checks
- explicit network policy
- no automatic generated-code execution
- no automatic infrastructure mutation

## Editions

The architecture is designed for Desktop, Server, Mobile, Edge/IoT and virtualized/CVEL editions. Hardware capabilities are detected and mapped to CPU/SIMD/GPU/NPU/FPGA/DSP/Edge classes. AI compilation can target IREE/MLIR/ONNX/TVM adapters where installed.
