# Chimera II OS — Consolidated Project Knowledge

**Date:** 2026-09-08
**Architecture:** Chimera II / R8192 research platform
**Status:** Experimental research implementation

## 1. Project vision

Chimera II is a research operating-system and processor ecosystem centered on an experimental wide-word architecture, a native R8192 ISA, and an integrated software stack spanning boot, kernel, scheduling, memory, device services, storage, networking, graphics, security, data services, and research/visualization workloads.

The project incorporates the previously developed Chimera II OS architecture, the 8192-bit processor model, Aurora graphics/Wayland work, Spotnik zero-copy I/O concepts, Hybrid kernel services, NDB/HIVE data concepts, CEF execution/data-flow concepts, Chronos scheduling, boot ABI/SF0, interoperability decoders, and associated documentation/provenance artifacts.

## 2. CPU model

The current conceptual processor exposes 1024 general-purpose registers of 8192 bits each. The software emulator remains a research model and must distinguish architectural intent from measured physical hardware behavior.

## 3. Native ISA

The native Chimera-R8192 opcode namespace is `0x0001..0x011C`, representing 284 supplied instruction identities. The ISA includes arithmetic/logic, wide shifts and rotates, multiplication/division, memory operations, DMA/IOMMU, zero-copy networking, system services, security/TPM, cryptography, modules, scheduling, memory management, VFS, NDB/HIVE, Aurora GPU/media/framebuffer operations, PCI/VirtIO, power/thermal, certificates/keystores, policy, cluster/service management, diagnostics and maintenance services.

## 4. Fetch/decode/execute

The native frontend uses a 16-bit opcode and normalized operand fields. The executor distinguishes four outcomes:

- `Executed`
- `PrivilegeViolation`
- `InvalidOpcode`
- `UnimplementedService`

This allows recognized service instructions to exist in the ISA without falsely representing an unavailable backend as implemented hardware.

## 5. Expanded encoding layer

The newly integrated encoding design adds machine-readable fields for:

- encoding class;
- bitfield template;
- opcode placement;
- immediate width;
- ModR/M-like addressing;
- example hexadecimal encoding.

These are explicitly **illustrative** until the project freezes a canonical encoding revision.

## 6. OS architecture

The consolidated architecture retains the major boundaries established in the repository:

```text
Boot / SF0
   ↓
Chimera Kernel
   ├── CPU8192 / R8192 execution
   ├── Chronos scheduler
   ├── virtual memory / paging
   ├── IPC / synchronization
   ├── security / policy
   └── service dispatch
        ├── Spotnik I/O / DMA / networking
        ├── VFS / storage
        ├── NDB / HIVE
        ├── Aurora GPU / Wayland
        └── Hybrid system services
```

## 7. Aurora

Aurora remains the presentation/graphics subsystem and Wayland-oriented desktop boundary. GPU and presentation instructions should be routed through explicit backends rather than treated as completed native CPU operations.

## 8. Spotnik

Spotnik represents high-performance I/O, page pinning, DMA, IOMMU and zero-copy networking concepts. These services are privileged where they cross kernel/device boundaries.

## 9. Security

The architecture includes privilege separation, module verification, TPM-oriented services, signatures, certificates, entropy/RNG, KASLR reseeding, policy controls and audit logging. Security instructions require explicit backend semantics and must not be considered implemented solely because they have opcode identities.

## 10. Interoperability

RV32I/RV64I, AArch64 and x86-64 remain interoperability targets. They are not claims of complete ISA compatibility. External ISA material should be referenced through clean-room interfaces and canonical specifications rather than copied wholesale.

## 11. Research model

The project also contains research-oriented ideas involving wide-bit computation, neural/cognitive simulation, visualization, multidimensional computing and the user's 128D conceptual framework. These are research concepts and should be labeled separately from normative operating-system and ISA behavior.

## 12. Provenance

The repository should preserve source provenance for generated artifacts, distinguish supplied specifications from implementation-derived metadata, and clearly label illustrative versus normative material.

## 13. Engineering rule

No generated document, opcode example, performance number, visualization, or conceptual model should be represented as physical hardware fact unless independently implemented and measured. The repository is a living research implementation whose normative behavior is established by source code, tests, and explicitly versioned specifications.
