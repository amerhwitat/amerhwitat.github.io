# Chimera II Neural + Trusted Node Fabric

## Goal

Koronos hosts a local-first cognitive runtime combining the existing 128D state model with recurrent temporal memory, transformer attention, retrieval, graph reasoning and Nucleus neural storage. The design is intentionally a hybrid rather than claiming that an RNN alone is an LLM.

## Cognitive pipeline

`perception -> 128D encoding -> RNN/GRU/LSTM temporal state -> retrieval/vector graph -> attention/reasoning -> policy/sandbox -> action`

Long-lived state is stored in Nucleus as model metadata, tensors, embeddings, memories, graph relations, checkpoints and provenance. Hive remains configuration/identity policy; Nucleus owns neural and analytical state.

## Trusted node federation

Every Chimera node has a cryptographic identity and capability document. Synchronization requires mutual authentication, signed capability metadata, replay protection, sequence numbers, content digests and an auditable trust epoch. Revocation is fail-closed.

Nodes exchange knowledge envelopes rather than executable code. A peer may propose model metadata, embeddings, research records, telemetry or signed checkpoints. Policy decides whether data is accepted. Remote code execution and unsigned model replacement are prohibited.

## Internet discovery

The discovery service is deliberately **non-scanning**. It can consume explicitly configured signed directories, DNS SRV/TXT records, mDNS/Bonjour on local networks and operator-supplied bootstrap peers. It does not probe arbitrary Internet addresses or perform unsolicited port scanning. This preserves the user's requested Internet-wide node discovery concept while keeping discovery bounded to published/consented endpoints.

## Synchronization

Use monotonic per-origin sequence numbers and content-addressed records. Conflict resolution is deterministic: verify signature -> verify trust epoch -> verify digest -> compare sequence -> apply policy -> persist audit event -> publish new local revision. Model checkpoints require provenance and signature validation before activation.

## Intelligence upgrades

The cognitive runtime should support:

- RNN/GRU/LSTM temporal memory.
- Transformer attention for long-context reasoning.
- Retrieval-augmented generation against Nucleus vectors and graph data.
- 128D observer/geometry state separation.
- Tool planning with capability-scoped actions.
- Local model routing across CPU/GPU/NPU providers.
- Federated knowledge exchange without blindly merging remote weights.
- Deterministic replay, evaluation suites and regression memory.

Windows ML demonstrates a modern local CPU/GPU/NPU inference-provider pattern; Linux provides useful reference patterns through eBPF, AF_XDP and io_uring; Apple's virtualization/security stack provides additional reference patterns for entitlement, isolation and hardware-assisted virtualization. These are architectural references, not copied implementations. citeturn0search13turn0search6turn0search8turn0search48

## Trust model

`unknown -> discovered -> authenticated -> attested -> trusted -> synchronized`

A node can move backward immediately on signature failure, replay detection, expired capability, revoked identity or policy violation.
