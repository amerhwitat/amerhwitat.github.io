# Chimera 128D Application Profile

This document defines the common multidimensional application profile used across the Chimera ecosystem.

## Baseline dimensions

1. Point/state location
2. Plane/relationships
3. Width, height and depth
4. Time/temporal ordering
5. Observer/perspective
6. Light, shadow and material response
7. Events
8. Objects, properties and interaction rules

The remaining dimensions form the extensible cognitive/information layer: perception, representation, memory, inference, action, context, relationships and higher-order vector/tensor state. Implementations use a 128D baseline but may extend to arbitrary dimensions without changing the envelope identity.

## Canonical envelope

```text
profile: chimera-128d
version: 1
node_id: stable peer identifier
object_id: content-addressed object identifier
time: monotonic + wall-clock metadata
perspective: observer/reference-frame metadata
geometry: n-dimensional vector/tensor state
properties: typed key/value state
relations: object/object and event/object links
events: ordered event records
cognition: optional perception/memory/inference/action vectors
extensions: namespaced dimensions above 128
integrity: payload hash
signature: optional authenticated signature
```

## Design rule

The 128D model is a semantic interoperability layer, not a requirement that every application allocate a literal 128-element array. Small applications may materialize only the dimensions they use and declare the rest as absent/default.

## Cross-language parity

C/C++, C#, Java, Node.js, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript and assembly-facing components must preserve field names, numeric semantics, ordering and integrity rules. Language-native APIs may differ; the logical state must not.
